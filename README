Hi all!

This is my edited version of ShestakUI for WoW, feel free to use it if you like it.
I've worked on this UI with a resolution of 1920x1080: if you use a different resolution, you may have to move or disable some elements.
Compared to the original UI, I just changed a bit of things to better fit to my personal taste, nothing more than this.
A BIG thank to Shestak for his amazing work (all credits go out to him)!
