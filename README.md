Hi all!

This is my edited version of ShestakUI for WoW, feel free to use it if you like it.

Compared to the original ShestakUI, I just changed a bit of things to better fit my personal taste, nothing more than that.

More details [here](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info21840-ShestakUI_OzEdit.html) and a big thank to Shestak for his amazing work (all credits go out to him) and to all his contributors!
