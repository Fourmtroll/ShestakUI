Hi all!

This is my edited version of ShestakUI for WoW, feel free to use it if you like it.

Compared to the original UI, I just changed a bit of things to better fit to my personal taste, nothing more than this.

More details on http://shestak.org/forum/showthread.php?t=835 and a BIG thank to Shestak for his amazing work (all credits go out to him) and to all his contributors!
